Binaural player
===============

About and copyright
-------------------

  Binaural player is an Android application to generate binaural beats
  <URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_beats >.

  It was mostly written by Nicolas George <nicolas.george@normalesup.org>.

  It is based on SBaGen <URL: http://uazu.net/sbagen/ > by Jim Peters.

Usage
-----

  It should be completely straightforward: install the application on the
  device; put some binaural sequences on the storage space of the device as
  files with the ".sbg" extension. Start the application, select the file in
  the list, put the headphones and click on play.


Technical details
-----------------

  Android interface

    At this time, I am quite recent to Android development. Therefore,
    expect a few glitches.

  SBaGen porting

    SBaGen is originally a standalone program, which is not usable in an
    Android application. It was necessary to turn it into a library, with
    specific entry points. Most of the work was to replace turn the calls to
    exit into a correct error-reporting scheme and remove memory leaks.

    To make this work manageable, a lot of features had to be removed. This
    version does not support mixing of input files, and only accepts simple
    sequence files in start-to-end (-SE) mode.

    This version of sbagen.c can probably be useful for applications in
    other embedded contexts.

  Build and Makefile

    This project does not use the official Android build system and
    directory layout. It rather uses a simple Makefile (with GNU
    extensions). It can be used as an example on how to build an Android
    application step by step.
